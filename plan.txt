Plan: use naive bayes to create a dictionary of keywords for fake news and real news sources.

1) transfer the naive bayes classify methods
2) translate naive bayes methods to this use case
3) find training data for the model
4) train and test the model
5) Once the model seems to working, uncomment the pickle methods
6) further train the model
7) Now that the model works, find out how to do scraping
8) take user input of url of news to check

**Important Note: try scraping from real and fake news websites in order to train the model**
 - Maybe make new project to explore scraping from news articles(maybe make one file for real scraped data and one for fake scraped data)
